# MVVM-C Templates

The main template generates a new scene using MVVM-C architecture used in [Futured apps](https://futured.app). For more specific navigation cases there are window, modal, show, push and tab bar scene templates. Also a basic table view cell template with model and XIB is available.

## Installation

The templates can be added to Xcode simply by cloning the repo and running `make` in it.

Also, they could be installed by running some template management tool like [xcman](https://github.com/josefdolezal/xcman):

```
xcman templates install --name MVVM-C\ Templates futuredapp/MVVM-C-Templates
```
